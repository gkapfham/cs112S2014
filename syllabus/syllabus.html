<h3>Course Objectives</h3>

<p>
The essence of the discipline of computer science is algorithms.
Software developers can also create a computer program to serve as a
concrete representation of an algorithm.  In particular, this course
will expose students to the notion of an object-oriented data
structure.  Students will delve into the issues that are related to
algorithm design, implementation, and analysis.  Specifically, the
course will introduce the student to abstract data types such
as <code>Stack</code>s, <code>Queue</code>s,
<code>String</code>s, <code>Tree</code>s, <code>Graph</code>s, and
<code>Hashtable</code>s.  Next, the course will expose the student to
fundamental concepts such as recursion, searching, and sorting.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, this course will provide a student's initial introduction
to the analysis of algorithms.  We will explore the analysis of
algorithms on two fronts. First, students will consider the analytical
(i.e., asymptotic) evaluation of algorithms.  Second, you will conduct
an empirical analysis of an algorithm with a variety of workloads and
experimentation environments.  Since the majority of the software
implementation tasks will use the Java programming language, this
course will frequently require students to use the object-oriented
programming paradigm and design patterns.  Whenever possible, the
course will highlight the connection between algorithms, data
structures, and other disciplines in the social and natural sciences.
</p>

<h3>Performance Objectives</h3>

<p>
At the completion of this semester, the student should be comfortable
with the object-oriented programming paradigm.  Also, students should
be able to handle many of the important, yet accidental, aspects of
implementing programs in the Java programming language.  That is,
students should be comfortable with one or two program editors and
compilers and be able to understand the purpose of shell environment
variables such as the <code>CLASSPATH</code>.  Students should have a
toolkit of abstract data types that they can use in the context of the
solutions to larger problems.  Students must have a strong grasp of
the basic building blocks of a programming language and a growing
knowledge of more advanced topics like loop invariants, formal
specifications, and recursion.  Finally, students should have a basic
knowledge of analytical and empirical techniques that they can use to
measure algorithm performance.
</p>

<h3>Required Reading Information</h3>

<p>
The primary text for this course is <b>Data Structures and Algorithms
in Java</b>, Fifth Edition.  This text was written by Michael
T. Goodrich and Roberto Tamassia.  This text provides a balanced, high
quality treatment of the topics that were listed in the Course
Objectives Section.
</p>

<h3>Additional Text Information</h3>

<p>
The required articles could be supplemented with excerpts from a
number of different sources.  Additional articles from important
computer science and software engineering magazines and journals, such
as
<i>Communications of the ACM</i>, <i>IEEE Software</i>, <i>IEEE
Computer</i>, and <i>IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</i>,
could be examined to further expand and deepen the scope of the
required material.  Technical papers available in the <a href =
"http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/">CiteSeer Repository</a> or the <a href
= "http://dl.acm.org/">ACM Digital Library</a> could also be used
as additional texts.  The Instructor may also select chapters from
additional texts, such as the free and online <em>Java Structures</em>
text book.  Finally, the class will regularly examine popular press
articles that discuss the broader issues associated with the
discipline of computer science.
</p>

<h3>Grading Policy</h3>

<p>
The grade that a student receives in this class will be based on class
participation, instructor meetings, grades on two interim exams, the
grade on the final exam, the grade for all of the laboratory and
homework assignments, and the grade for the final project.  The grade
breakdown will follow the form below.  All percentages are approximate
and it is possible for the assigned percentages to change if a need to
do so presents itself.

<h3>Instructor Meeting Policy</h3>

<p>
All students are required to meet individually with the instructor to
discuss their status in the class and work towards improving their
understanding of the principles and practice of data structures and
algorithms.  During these meetings, which must be scheduled to take
place during my office hours, students will discuss the concepts
introduced during a class session, ask questions about the laboratory
assignments, review for an examination, or develop ideas for the final
project.  By the end of the semester, each student is required to have
met with the instructor for a total of, at minimum,
one-hundred-and-twenty minutes.  Students are also responsible for
both maintaining a record of their instructor meetings and submitting
this record on the day of the final examination.
</p>

<h3>Assignment Submission Policy</h3>

<p>
All assignments will have a given due date.  The printed version of
the assignment is to be turned in at the beginning of the class on
that due date.  Late assignments will be accepted for up to one week
past the assigned due date with a 10% penalty.  All late assignments
must be submitted at the beginning of the class that is scheduled one
week after the given due date.
</p>

<h3>Class Attendance Policy</h3>

<p>
It is mandatory for all students to attend class.  If you will not be
able to attend a class session, then please see the Instructor at
least one week in advance in order to describe your situation.
Students who miss more than five unexcused classes will have their
final grade in the course reduced by one letter grade.  Students who
miss more than ten unexcused classes will automatically fail the
course.
</p>

<h3>Laboratory Attendance Policy</h3>

<p>
In order to explore the discipline of computer science, it is
essential for students to have hands-on experience in a laboratory.
Therefore, it is mandatory for all students to attend laboratory
sessions. If you will not be able to attend a laboratory, then please
see the Instructor at least one week in advance in order to explain
your situation.  Students who miss more than two unexcused
laboratories will have their final grade in the course reduced by one
letter grade.  Students who miss more than four unexcused laboratories
will automatically fail the course.
</p>

<h3>Laboratory and Homework Assignments</h3>

<p><p> Laboratory assignments will ask students to conduct experiments
to learn more about the Java programming language and explore
different techniques for analyzing, designing, and implementing
software solutions to real-world problems.  All laboratory assignments
will require the use of the provided software tools to write programs
that conduct experiments and solve problems.  Unless specified
otherwise, students must conduct laboratory assignments in an
individual fashion.  Each laboratory assignment will be due at the
beginning of the next laboratory session unless the assignment sheet
states otherwise.  Students are responsible for maintaining a
laboratory notebook that records their experiences during the
laboratory session.  Finally, homework assignments will invite
students to write papers and give presentations about topics related
to this course.
</p>

</p>

<h3>Final Project</h3>

<p>
This class will often present you with the description of a problem
and invite you to implement and evaluate a solution.  The final
project in this class will require you to utilize all of the knowledge
that you have accumulated during the course of the semester in order
to solve a problem with one or more programming languages and software
development tools.  The project will ask you to draw upon your problem
solving skills and your knowledge of the principles and practice of
object-oriented software development.  Furthermore, the final project
may involve a significant experiment to discover, understand, and/or
evaluate one or more algorithms or software applications.
</p> 

<h3>Policy for the Use of Laboratory Facilities</h3>

<p>
Throughout the semester, we will try many different software tools
that computer scientists use throughout the software development life
cycle.  The Instructor and the Department's Systems Administrator have
invested a considerable amount of time to ensure that our laboratories
support the completion of laboratory and homework assignments and the
final project.  To this end, students will be required to complete all
assignments and the final project while using the department's
laboratory facilities. The Instructor and the Systems Administrator
will only be able to devote a limited amount of time to the
configuration of a student's personal computer.
</p>

<h3>Preparation for Class Sessions</h3>

<p>
The study of the computer science discipline is very challenging.
Students in this class will be invited to learn the principles of
algorithm analysis, examine a host of abstract data types, hone their
problem solving skills, and learn about new software development
environments. During the coming semester even the most diligent
student will experience times of frustration when they are attempting
to understand a challenging concept or complete a difficult laboratory
assignment.  In many situations some of the material that we examine
will initially be confusing &mdash; do not despair!  Press on and
persevere!
</p>

<p>
In order to minimize confusion, students must invest time to prepare
for class discussions and lectures.  During our class periods, the
Instructor will often pose demanding questions that could require
group consultation, the creation of a program, or a vote on a
thought-provoking issue.  Only students who have prepared for class by
reading the assigned material and reviewing the laboratory and reading
assignments will be able to effectively participate in these
discussions.  More importantly, only prepared students will be able to
extract the knowledge that is needed to be successful in this course.
Important portions of the material that will be discussed during the
semester will not be in the textbook.
</p>

<p>
In order to help students to remain organized and effectively prepare
for classes, the Instructor will maintain a class schedule with
reading assignments and additional Instructor notes.  The reading
assignments will be directly integrated into the class schedule.
Throughout the class sessions students will also be required to
download, use, and modify Java programs; it is also likely that
students will be asked to use programs that are written in other
languages.  Each of these program segments will be provided on the
course Web site.  Students who are not comfortable with compiling,
editing, and using simple Java programs should see the Instructor
immediately.
</p>

<p>  
Remember this motto, <em>semper paratus</em>!
</p>

<h3>Submitted Source Code Policy</h3>

<p>
All of your submitted source code must have your name and the date
clearly printed at the top of the page.  All source code that is not
submitted in this fashion will be assigned a total of zero points.
That is, the student will earn an "F" on this laboratory or portion of
the final project.  The first time that a student violates this
requirement, he/she will be given a resubmit option.  After this
single resubmit option has been exercised, a student will be awarded
an "F" for all further infractions.
</p>

<h3>Disability Services</h3>

<p>
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal
anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights
protection for persons with disabilities.  Among other things, this
legislation requires all students with disabilities be guaranteed a
learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of
their disabilities.  Students with disabilities who believe they may
need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Disability
Services at +1 814-332-2898.  Disability Services is part of the
Learning Commons and is located in Pelletier Library.  Please do this
as soon as possible to ensure that approved accommodations are
implemented in a timely fashion.
</p>

<h3>Honor Code</h3>

<p>
The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at
Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny College Course
Catalog.  The Honor Program applies to all work that is submitted for
academic credit or to meet non-credit requirements for graduation at
Allegheny College.  This includes all work done in class (e.g.,
examinations, quizzes, and laboratory work), all papers, and any other
material that might be assigned in this class.
<i>All students who have enrolled in the College will work under the
Honor Program</i>.  Each student who has matriculated at Allegheny
College has acknowledged the following pledge:
</p>

<p>
<i>
I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as
defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both
myself and the College community as a whole.
</i>
</p>

<p>
In this course, students are encouraged to conduct high-level
discussions with their fellow classmates about the laboratory
assignments.  The Instructor considers it a violation of the honor
code for students to share segments of source code on the laboratory
assignments. If students are experiencing difficulties with the
low-level details of a laboratory, then they are encouraged to seek
help from the Instructor.  The Instructor reserves the right to use
several different automated tools that scan Java source code to check
for plagiarism violations.  Furthermore, the Instructor reserves the
right to use different automated tools to scan written responses to
assignments for plagiarism violations.
