<h2>Lab 6: Using the Stack Abstract Data Type to Implement an Arithmetic Interpreter</h2></a>

<h2><em>Assigned: Tuesday, March 26, 2013</em></h2>

<h2><em>Due: Wednesday, April 3, 2013</em></h2>

<hr>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>
To familiarize ourselves with the use of the Stack abstract data type.
Specifically, to implement a simple <code>StackMachine</code> that
will support a primitive language that can perform arithmetic with a
Stack.  Optionally, to explore the implementation of a test suite for
the Stack abstract data type.
</p>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<p>
In order to satisfactorily complete this laboratory assignment, you
must submit the following deliverables.  The laboratory notebook
deliverable must be posted on a course Web site page for this
laboratory.  There must be a link to your laboratory notebook at the
page that is linked to at the course web site page for this
laboratory.  Students are encouraged to record additional insights
about the laboratory session in this notebook area.  Failure to
include a laboratory notebook will result in the deduction of points.
Please see the Instructor if you do not understand these instructions.
Each of the printed code segments must include a signed pledge on the
document.  When you submit the laboratory assignment, please use your
laboratory notebook as the cover sheet for your source code and
output.

<h4>Laboratory Notebook</h4> 

<ol>

<li>

<p>
Please comment on some problem that can be solved by using the Stack
abstract data type.  Your comments should include a brief introduction
to the problem and a discussion of how the Stack abstract data type is
incorporated in your solution.  You can document a problem that you
have developed where the use of a Stack would be beneficial.
Alternatively, you can search the Internet to find some well-known
problems that require the use of a Stack.  You might consider
discussing the "infix to postfix" conversion example. After searching
the Internet for details about this example, please see the Instructor
if you are interested in learning more about it.
</p>

<li>

<p>
A review of each pitfall or problem that you encountered during the
laboratory and a discussion of the techniques that you used to
overcome this difficulty.  If no difficulties were encountered, then
please include a record of important commands, notes, etc. that you
think will be useful during later laboratories.
</p>

</ol>

<h4>Source Code and Output</h4>

<ol>

<li> 

<p>
The source code listing for the class <code>StackMachine</code> that
is included in the file <code>StackMachine.java</code>.  Your
implementation must meet the specifications outlined below.
</p>

<li>

<p>
The output from the execution of the <code>StackMachine</code> class.
Your output should clearly demonstrate the functionality of each
operator that the <code>StackMachine</code> supports.  You do not need
to demonstrate all unique combinations of <code>StackMachine</code>
functionality.
</p>

<p>
Your Java classes must fully meet the specifications that are outlined
later in the laboratory assignment.  Furthermore, they must adhere to
the following stylistic conventions.
</p>

</ol>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
There must be comments at the beginning with your name and the word
``PLEDGE'' (you must sign the program here before you hand in the
printout). Following this, there should be comments briefly describing
what the program does.  Use the standard JavaDoc commenting tags
(like <code>@author</code> inside of a
<code>/** ... */</code> comment block).
</p>

<li>

<p>
There should be comments as needed throughout the program to explain
variables and summarize the important points in your program.  For
example, when you declare a variable, you should include a comment
that describes the purpose of this variable.  When you assign a new
value to a variable, you should include a comment to describe the
intended purpose of the assignment.
</p>

<li>

<p>
The indenting scheme of your Java program must be consistent-all
``{...}''  pairs should be aligned, all statements inside ``{...}''
should be indented the same amount. Remember, <code>emacs</code> can
help with this!
</p>

<li>

<p>
Use blank lines in your program to improve readability and to separate
things into logical groupings of statements. For instance, it makes
sense to group your variable declarations together and separate them
from other statements.
</p>

<li>

<p>
Use Courier or another fixed-width font for the program and the output.
</p>

<li>

<p>
All of your Java code and output must be printed so that it has the
date
<em>on which the code was printed</em> at the top of the page.  If you
are having trouble printing, then please see the Instructor.
</p>

</ol>

</ol>

<h2>Software Development Assignment</h2>

<p>
A machine with only a single stack for storage is called a
<code>StackMachine</code>.  A stack machine can have a primitive
language that describes the operations that it can perform.  Consider
the following primitive language for a stack machine:
</p>

<table border = 1>

<tr>
<td>Command</td><td>Meaning</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>int</em></td><td>push <em>int</em> on the stack</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>+</td><td>push a '+' on the stack</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>s</td><td>push an 's' on the stack</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>e</td><td>evaluate the top of the stack (see below)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>d</td><td>display contents of the stack</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>x</td><td>stop the stack machine</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
The 'd' command simply prints out the contents of the stack, one element
per line, beginning with the top of the stack.  The behavior of the 'e'
command depends on the contents of the stack when the 'e' is
issued.  The following describes the rules that the 'e' command must follow:
</p>

<ol>

<li> 

<p>
If '+' is on the top of the stack, then the '+' is popped off the stack,
the following two integers are popped and added, and the result is pushed
back on the stack.
</p>

<li> 

<p>
If 's' is on top of the stack, then the 's' is popped off the stack and
the following two items are swapped on the stack.
</p>

<li> 

<p>
If an integer is on the top of the stack, or the stack is empty, then
the stack is left unchanged.
</p>

</ol>

<p>
The following examples illustrates the impact of the 'e' command in
various situations.  Note that in these examples, the top of the stack
is on the left.
</p>

<table border = 1>

<tr> 
<td>Stack Before</td><td>Stack After</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><pre>+ 1 2 5 s ...</pre></td><td><pre>3 5 s ...</pre></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><pre>s 1 + + 99 ...</pre></td><td><pre>+ 1 + 99 ...</pre></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><pre>1 + 3 ...</pre></td><td><pre>1 + 3 ...</pre></td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
You must implement an interpreter for this simple language.  Input to
the program is a series of commands, with one per line.  The
interpreter should prompt for commands with <code>>>>>></code> or
something else appropriate.  You do not need to do any error checking.
That is, you can assume that all commands are valid and that the
appropriate number of arguments are on the stack for evaluation.  You
can implement a sensible exception handling system for extra credit.
Finally, be aware of the fact that you will have to decide what types
of variables are going to be pushed on and popped off the stack.  This
choice may impact the types of casting that you will perform inside
of your
<code>StackMachine</code>.
</p>

<p>
You should implement this system in an object-oriented fashion and
your <code>StackMachine</code> may use an instance of
<code>java.util.Stack</code>.  Yet, you are encouraged to implement
your own <code>Stack</code>, using the examples provided in the
textbook.  However, implementation of your own stack is not required
for the purposes of this laboratory.  You should consider the use of
<code>ConsoleReader</code> or <code>Scanner</code> in the
implementation of your
<code>StackMachine</code>.  Make sure that the header of each class
and every method of each class is commented in an appropriate fashion.
You must use JavaDoc comments to describe the methods inside of your
classes.
</p>

<p>
Students will be awarded extra credit if they implement a test suite
for the one or more of the data
types <code>java.util.Stack</code>, <code>ArrayStack</code>,
or <code>NodeStack</code>.  If you implement a test suite
for <code>java.util.Stack</code>, it should be called
<code>TestStack</code> and it should adhere to the JUnit testing
framework (similar naming conventions would apply to the test suites
for the other Stack implementations).  A test suite should contain at
least ten individual test cases that test some functionality of the
Stack abstract data type (ADT).  One example of a test case for any
Stack implementation would involve pushing multiple data items onto
the Stack and then verifying that the top of the stack is correct.  If
you were testing the <code>ArrayStack</code>, you should also consider
tests that check to ensure that it throws the appropriate exceptions
at the appropriate time (e.g., when the Stack is full and
a <code>push</code> is performed or when the Stack is empty and
a <code>pop</code> is executed).  Please see the Instructor if you
would like to learn more about writing test cases with JUnit.  Any
student who finds a substantial defect in
the <code>java.util.Stack</code> from the Java library will be awarded
additional extra credit.
